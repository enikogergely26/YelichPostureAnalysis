# Christian Yelich Posture Analysis
This project investigates the impact of Christian Yelich's knee injury on his batting performance, focusing on the changes in his body posture and their correlation with his hitting metrics. The analysis spans from Yelich's peak seasons in 2018-2019 through to 2023, examining how postural changes may have contributed to his decline and recent recovery in performance.

## Key Components
**1. Hypotheses:**
- There are differences in Yelich’s posture before and after his injury.
- A correlation exists between his body alignment and hitting performance.
- Yelich may have a right-sided anterior pelvic tilt.

**2. Methodology:**
- Collected and analyzed batting stance images from MLB videos.
- Measured and compared six key angles in Yelich's posture.
- Applied statistical tests (T-tests, correlation analysis) to evaluate differences and relationships.

**3. Findings:**
- Significant postural changes were observed after Yelich's 2019 knee injury.
- Strong correlations were found between specific postural angles and hitting performance metrics like OBP and SLG.
- The hypothesis of a right-sided anterior pelvic tilt was suggested but not statistically confirmed.

**4. Conclusions:**
- Postural adjustments, particularly in hip rotation, may play a crucial role in Yelich’s batting performance.
- Further adjustments and a comprehensive approach to posture correction could help improve his performance and prevent future injuries.
